I commented most of the code in the index file, so I won't do too much explaining here.

To run the file, simply open the directory in the command line and run "node index.js".


I would just like to quickly mention that I used a local npm install of Jest for my tests.
I run them with the 'npm run test' command.

So when you first open the project, you may need to run an npm install to have access to jest.
I will not include node modules in the zip I send you.
If you have Jest installed globally, you may not need to npm install.
